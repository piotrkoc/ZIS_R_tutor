@article{Chen.2020,
 abstract = {Psychologists use scales comprised of multiple items to measure underlying constructs. Missing data on such scales often occur at the item level, whereas the model of interest to the researcher is at the composite (scale score) level. Existing analytic approaches cannot easily accommodate item-level missing data when models involve composites. A very common practice in psychology is to average all available items to produce scale scores. This approach, referred to as available-case maximum likelihood (ACML), may produce biased parameter estimates. Another approach researchers use to deal with item-level missing data is scale-level full information maximum likelihood (SL-FIML), which treats the whole scale as missing if any item is missing. SL-FIML is inefficient and it may also exhibit bias. Multiple imputation (MI) produces the correct results using a simulation-based approach. We study a new analytic alternative for item-level missingness, called two-stage maximum likelihood (TSML; Savalei {\&} Rhemtulla, Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, 42(4), 405-431. 2017). The original work showed the method outperforming ACML and SL-FIML in structural equation models with parcels. The current simulation study examined the performance of ACML, SL-FIML, MI, and TSML in the context of univariate regression. We demonstrated performance issues encountered by ACML and SL-FIML when estimating regression coefficients, under both MCAR and MAR conditions. Aside from convergence issues with small sample sizes and high missingness, TSML performed similarly to MI in all conditions, showing negligible bias, high efficiency, and good coverage. This fast analytic approach is therefore recommended whenever it achieves convergence. R code and a Shiny app to perform TSML are provided.},

 abstract = {Multiple imputation by chained equations is a flexible and practical approach to handling missing data. We describe the principles of the method and show how to impute categorical and quantitative variables, including skewed variables. We give guidance on how to specify the imputation model and how many imputations are needed. We describe the practical analysis of multiply imputed data, including model building and model checking. We stress the limitations of the method and discuss the possible pitfalls. We illustrate the ideas using a data set in mental health, giving Stata code fragments.},
